## My Names

The My Names screen lists all of the names that you've reserved for yourself. 
The following example has 1 name, but you could have many more.

There are 4 columns:

* **XAYA Name:** This is the proper name that you've reserved.
* **Name Value (optional):** This is simply the JSON expression of your name.
* **Address:** This is the CHI address for your name.
* **Update/Transfer:** This allows you to change the properties of your name or to 
transfer your name (account) to someone else.

### Updating a Name

Unless you fully understand what an update is, you should NOT update your name. 
Updating names is an advanced feature meant for experts.

### Transferring a Name

You can transfer a name to someone else by sending the name to a valid CHI 
address.

1. Click TRANSFER for the name you wish to transfer.

2. Paste in the CHI address that you want to transfer the name to.

[Transactions screen](#transactions).
