## Send

The Send screen lets you send CHI to other people at their CHI addresses.

To send CHI to another CHI address:

1. Paste the address into the Pay to Address input. (Do not type addresses.)

2. Enter how much CHI you want to send into the Amount Value input.

3. Optionally, you can choose to enter the amount in CHI, mCHI or uCHI. (Using 
the default CHI is recommended.)

4. Check whether or not fees should be subtracted from the amount you are 
sending.

5. Optionally, you can enter a comment, e.g. "Sending 5 CHI to Alice".

6. Click SEND.

You can check your transaction on the [Transactions screen](#transactions).

<aside class="warning">DO NOT TYPE ADDRESSES.</aside>

Typing address is highly discouraged. You could make a simple mistake, and lose 
your CHI.

We **STRONGLY** recommend copying and pasting addresses.

<aside class="notice">The Send screen is not for transferring names. See <a href="#transferring-a-name">Transferring a name</a> for more information.</aside>
