### Balance

The Balance area on the Overview screen displays how much CHI you have in the 
[currently selected wallet](#wallets).

It displays the amount in full to 8 decimal places.

Should you "be surprised" at an amount in your wallet, it may be that you've 
simple got the wrong one selected.

See [Wallets](#wallets) for more information.
