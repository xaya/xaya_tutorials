## Console

The console is for testing purposes only. It is provided for those who wish to 
get blockchain information and should not be used to write to the blockchain.

Type "help" then press Enter or click SEND for a list of commands.

<aside class="warning">Not all commands are supported in the XAYA Electron wallet. Use the XAYA QT wallet for full support.</aside>

An example of a useful command is "getmininginfo". It returns the current 
results, similar to the figure below.

Those wishing to perform more advanced operations should work with the XAYA 
daemon directly or download the XAYA QT wallet. It is similar to the Bitcoin 
Core wallet.
