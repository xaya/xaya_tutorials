## Transactions

The Transactions screen has a complete record of your transaction history.

The relevant fields are:

* **Address:** The address in your wallet involved in the transaction.
* **Name/Label:** If the transaction was for a name, then relevant name information 
is displayed here. Often these are game moves.
* **Category:** This tells you whether you sent or received CHI, as well as whether 
the coins are generated (mined).
* **Amount:** This is the amount of CHI. Sent CHI are negative, and received CHI are 
positive.
* **Date:** This is the date and time of the transaction in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 
format.
* **Confirmations:** This is the number of confirmations for the transaction. 
Loosely speaking, this is how many blocks have been mined since then.
