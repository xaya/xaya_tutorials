## Create Names

Creating names is one of the most important aspects of the wallet. Here you can 
create names for accounts that you use for different games.

### Choosing an Account Name

To create a name for use as an account for games:

1. Choose the "p/" namespace from the Select preset namespace drop-down menu. 
This is for reserving account names.

3. Leave the Name Value input empty.

4. Click SUBMIT NAME.

You can check your acount name on the [My Names screen](#my-names).

### Choosing a Game Name

This is not the actual name of your game. XAYA uses "name" as jargon. Here, a 
"game name" is more traditionally best described as a "game ID".

To create a name for use as game name:

1. Choose the "g/" namespace from the Select preset namespace drop-down menu. 
This is for reserving game names.

2. Type a name in the Name input as shown above.

3. Leave the Name Value input empty.

4. Click SUBMIT NAME.

You can check your game name on the [My Names screen](#my-names).

### Choosing a Custom Namespace

Custom namespaces are reserved for further development.

There is little to no point in reserving a name in a custom namespace. Some developers may find a use, but are discouraged from using custom namespaces without serious consideration.
